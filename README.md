# About 

This is a project extension for the Algorithms course by team `Pied Piper`. It's main aim is :

1. Exploring the various concepts and implementing bottom up , various compression and encryption Algorithms. 
2. Explore concepts of Cellular Automaton and implement self-designed encryption engine using elementary cellular Automaton.
3. Understand concepts like Cellular Automaton Transform, etc. that have huge potential for applications in encryption and lossy data compression. 
4. Implement Image compression algorithms like K-means, JPEG, PBIC.
5. Implement from scratch data compression and binary file compression algorithms like Huffman and Arithmetic Compression.
6. Produce analysis papers for the concepts learnt and implemented.
